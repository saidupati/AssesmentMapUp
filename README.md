# about map application

The Map Application is a simple web application that allows users to view and interact with maps of different regions. It provides information about selected regions, such as the United States, India, and the United Kingdom, including their currency, speed unit, distance unit, volume unit, and timezone.

1. Region Selection: Users can select a region from a dropdown menu to view its corresponding map and region information.

2. Map View: The application displays the selected region's map using the Leaflet library, centered on the region's coordinates, and with an appropriate zoom level.

3. Region Information: Alongside the map, the application presents relevant information about the selected region, including its name, currency, speed unit, distance unit, volume unit, and timezone.

4. Authentication and Profile: The application allows users to sign up and log in to access their profile information, including their name and address.

5. The application uses React and Redux to manage state and provide a smooth user experience.

6. ESLint with the Airbnb style guide is used to maintain code quality and adhere to best practices.

7. The application is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
